/*
 *   File: blank.screen.c
 *   Description: C program for the ATMEL AVR microcontroller (ATmega32 chip)
 *   Write charactes on the the screen
 *
 *
 *  Includes (pretty much compulsory for using the Teensy this semester)
 * 	- avr/io.h: port and pin definitions (i.e. DDRB, PORTB, PB1, etc)
 *	- util/delay.h: '_delay_ms()' function
 *	- cpu_speed.h: macros for forcing the CPU speed to 8MHz (nothing else should ever be used!)
 *  - graphics.h: library to interact with the LCD
